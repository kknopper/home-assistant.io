The `mqtt` device tracker platform allows you to define new device_trackers through [manual YAML configuration](#yaml-configuration) in `configuration.yaml` and also to automatically discover device_trackers [using the MQTT Discovery protocol](#using-the-discovery-protocol).

<div class='note info'>
  At the moment, manual configured device trackers can only reloaded by restarting Home Assistant.
</div>

## Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  device_tracker:
  - name: "annetherese_n4"
    state_topic: "location/annetherese"
  - name: "paulus_oneplus"
    state_topic: "location/paulus"
```

{% details "Previous configuration format" %}

The configuration format of manual configured MQTT items has changed.
The old format that places configurations under the `switch` platform key
should no longer be used and is deprecated.

The above example shows the new and modern way,
this is the previous/old example and deprecated configuration schema:

```yaml
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: "location/paulus"
      annetherese_n4: "location/annetherese"
```

To set the state of the device_tracker then you need to publish a JSON message to the topic (e.g., via mqtt.publish service). As an example, the following JSON message would set the `paulus_oneplus` device_tracker to `home`:

```json
{
  "topic": "location/paulus",
  "payload": "home"
}
```

## Examples

### Using the discovery protocol

The device_tracker can be created via a discovery topic that follows the following topic name convention: `<discovery_prefix>/device_tracker/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config`.

You can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.

To create the device_tracker:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t homeassistant/device_tracker/a4567d663eaf/config -m '{"state_topic": "a4567d663eaf/state", "name": "My Tracker", "payload_home": "home", "payload_not_home": "not_home"}'
```

To set the state of the device tracker to "home":

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m 'home'
```

To set the state of the device tracker to a named location:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m 'location_name'
```

If the device supports GPS coordinates then they can be sent to Home Assistant by specifying an attributes topic (i.e. "json_attributes_topic") in the configuration payload:

- Attributes topic: `a4567d663eaf/attributes`
- Example attributes payload:

```json
{
  "latitude": 32.87336,
  "longitude": -117.22743,
  "gps_accuracy": 1.2
 }
```

To create the device_tracker with GPS coordinates support:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t homeassistant/device_tracker/a4567d663eaf/config -m '{"state_topic": "a4567d663eaf/state", "name": "My Tracker", "payload_home": "home", "payload_not_home": "not_home", "json_attributes_topic": "a4567d663eaf/attributes"}'
```

To set the state of the device tracker to specific coordinates:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m '{"latitude": 32.87336, "longitude": -117.22743, "gps_accuracy": 1.2}'
```


### YAML configuration

The following example shows how to configure the same device tracker through configuration.yaml

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  device_tracker:
    - name: "My Tracker"
      state_topic: "a4567d663eaf/state"
      payload_home: "home"
      payload_not_home: "not_home"
```

{% endraw %}
