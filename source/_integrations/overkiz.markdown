The Overkiz (by Somfy) integration platform is used by many different vendors, like Somfy, Hitachi, and Atlantic. This integration will allow users to integrate their devices into Home Assistant using the Overkiz API.

## Supported hubs

- Atlantic Cozytouch
- Hitachi Hi Kumo
- Nexity Eug√©nie
- Rexel Energeasy Connect
- Somfy Connectivity Kit
- Somfy Connexoon IO
- Somfy Connexoon RTS
- Somfy TaHoma
- Somfy TaHoma Beecon
- Somfy TaHoma Switch
- Thermor Cozytouch


## Supported devices

Over 6000 devices from 60 brands are compatible with the Overkiz platform. This integration will retrieve your devices and map them to the relevant Home Assistant platforms.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Known limitations

### Z-Wave, Hue and Sonos not supported

Even though most Overkiz hubs support adding Z-Wave, Hue, and Sonos devices, this isn't supported in the Overkiz integration. All these platforms have native integrations in Home Assistant which are more stable and feature-rich.

### Overkiz API limits

**Server busy, please try again later. (Too many executions)**

During peak hours, it could happen that the Overkiz platform is unable to execute your command. The integration will try to retry this command, however, this is not guaranteed to succeed.

### Internet connectivity required

This integration communicates via the cloud-based Overkiz API. The Somfy TaHoma v2 and the Somfy TaHoma Switch offer the [Somfy TaHoma Developer Mode (local API)](https://developer.somfy.com/developer-mode), which is not supported in Home Assistant yet.

Another option if you are only using Somfy IO compatible devices is to purchase a Velux KLF200 hub and use [the Velux integration](/integrations/velux/) which has a local API.

#### Local API via HomeKit Controller

If your hub (e.g. Somfy TaHoma) supports HomeKit natively, your setup code will be added as a sensor in Home Assistant. Look up your hub in Home Assistant and retrieve the value from the 'HomeKit Setup Code' sensor. You can now configure the [HomeKit Controller](/integrations/homekit_controller/) integration in Home Assistant and benefit from local support. Only a [limited set of devices is supported](https://service.somfy.com/downloads/nl_v5/tahoma-homekitcompatibilitylist_eng.pdf).
